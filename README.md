## Overview

数字化AI助手 (`@happyzengfen/pi-alpha-desk`) is a Next.js + React web UI derived from upstream [pi-web](https://github.com/agegr/pi-web) `v0.7.16`. It provides a visual workspace for local pi sessions while preserving compatibility with pi's session storage, models, authentication, skills, plugins, and theme formats.

This repository is not an upstream mirror. It prioritizes its own product experience and selectively adopts upstream SDK compatibility, security, correctness, and reliability improvements.

### Current baseline

| Area | Version |
| --- | --- |
| Application | `0.8.7` |
| Node.js | `>=22.19.0` |
| Next.js | `16.3.0` |
| React | `19.2.x` |
| pi SDK registry fallback | `0.84.0` |

## Highlights

- **Local session workspace** — browse, rename, delete, fork, branch, export, and resume pi JSONL sessions.
- **Real-time conversations** — per-session SSE streaming, reconnect and running-state recovery, compaction support, tool output, thinking display, and process timelines.
- **Standalone dist build** — `npm run build` produces a self-contained `dist/` with `server.js` and runtime dependencies.
- **Project and Git tools** — file explorer, fuzzy file search, Git status and diff views, quick changes, and Git worktree management.
- **Rich file preview** — source code, diffs, images, audio, PDF, and DOCX files.
- **Model and authentication management** — configure models, test providers, manage API keys, and complete supported OAuth or device-code login flows.
- **Skills and plugins** — inspect loaded resources, search and install skills, manage package plugins, and protect project resources with a trust gate.
- **Rich Markdown** — GitHub-flavored Markdown, syntax highlighting, Mermaid diagrams, KaTeX math, and sanitized embedded HTML.
- **Themes and localization** — pi / PI-TUI JSON themes, dark/light/system modes, English, and Simplified Chinese.

## Install and run

### Production dist (standalone)

```bash
npm install
npm run build
cd dist
node server.js
```

`npm run build` produces a self-contained `dist/` with `server.js`, `.next`, `public`, `bundled-*`, and runtime `node_modules`. You can delete the repo-root `node_modules` and still run `node server.js` from `dist/` (requires Node.js `>=22.19.0` on the host).

Default URL: [http://127.0.0.1:30141](http://127.0.0.1:30141). From the repo root you can also use `npm start`.

### Run from source

Requirements:

- Node.js `>=22.19.0`
- npm
- An existing pi configuration, or provider credentials configured from the application

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:30141](http://localhost:30141). The default development command uses Webpack; Turbopack is available with `npm run dev:turbo`.

## Runtime behavior

- The server listens on `127.0.0.1:30141` by default.
- Five general-purpose Pi plugins are bundled as exact application dependencies: subagents, MCP, web access, structured questions, and goals. Their versions and npm integrity values are recorded in `bundled-plugins/manifest.json`.
- Bundled starter skills are copied into the active pi agent skills directory when missing. Existing user copies are preserved. See `bundled-skills/manifest.json`.

## Data, sessions, and project access

- **Agent data directory** — defaults to `~/.pi/agent/`; set `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` to use another pi agent directory.
- **Session files** — stored under `~/.pi/agent/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/<timestamp>_<uuid>.jsonl` by default.
- **Model configuration** — the Models panel reads and writes `models.json` in the active pi agent directory.
- **Fork vs branch** — Fork creates a new `.jsonl` session file; **Edit from here** creates another branch inside the same session file.
- **File access** — browsing and preview are restricted to session working directories, resolved project roots, generated `~/pi-cwd-*` directories, and explicitly allowed roots.
- **Project trust** — project extensions, packages, prompts, and `.agents/skills` resources must be trusted before the SDK loads or executes them.
- **Git worktrees** — sessions from a main checkout and linked worktrees remain grouped by project root. See [Worktrees in pi-web](./docs/worktrees.md).

## Themes

数字化AI助手 reads pi-compatible theme JSON files from:

```text
~/.pi/agent/themes/       # global themes
<project>/.pi/themes/     # project themes
```

See the [official pi theme documentation](https://pi.dev/docs/latest/themes) for the complete schema and color definitions.

Themes are grouped by base name. Pair `-dark.json` and `-light.json` files to provide matching variants:

```text
gruvbox-dark.json
gruvbox-light.json
```

A single `<theme-name>.json` file is also supported. If the requested variant is missing, the application falls back to the single file or the opposite variant.

Example theme pairs are available in [`docs/themes/`](./docs/themes/):

- `gruvbox-dark.json` / `gruvbox-light.json`
- `solarized-dark.json` / `solarized-light.json`

## Web and LAN access

The web server listens on `127.0.0.1` by default. Do not expose it to an untrusted network.

For an intentional LAN setup:

```bash
PI_WEB_PASSWORD='replace-with-a-strong-password' npm run dev:lan
```

Basic Auth uses username `pi` and the value of `PI_WEB_PASSWORD` as the password. HTTP Basic Auth does not encrypt credentials, so use HTTPS termination or a trusted VPN. Host and browser-origin checks remain enforced; use `PI_WEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS` for additional explicit hostnames when necessary.

Common runtime variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `PORT` | Server port; default `30141` |
| `PI_WEB_HOSTNAME` | Bind and allowed hostname; CLI default `127.0.0.1` |
| `PI_WEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Additional comma-separated allowed hostnames |
| `PI_WEB_PASSWORD` | Enables Web/LAN Basic Auth |
| `PI_WEB_NO_OPEN` | Prevents the npm CLI from opening a browser |
| `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` | Overrides the pi agent data directory |
| `SKILLS_API_URL` | Overrides the skills search API |

The npm CLI also accepts `--port` / `-p`, `--hostname` / `-H`, and `--no-open`.

## Development

### Common commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Next.js development server on `127.0.0.1:30141` using Webpack |
| `npm run dev:turbo` | Next.js development server using Turbopack |
| `npm test` | Run the explicit cross-platform source `*.test.mjs` suite |
| `./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit` | Type-check the project |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |
| `npm run build` | Production build and assemble standalone `dist/` |
| `npm start` | Start `dist/server.js` |
| `cd dist && node server.js` | Run the standalone package without repo-root `node_modules` |

Prefer `npm run dev` during active development. Use `npm run build` when you need to verify the standalone `dist/` package.

### Local pi snapshots

The four direct pi SDK dependencies use registry version `0.84.0` as the reproducible fallback. For local development, the sync script can build and install six commit-stamped packages from a clean pi checkout without changing `package.json` or `package-lock.json`:

```bash
# Uses the default sibling directory ../pi
npm run pi:sync-local

# Or choose an explicit source checkout
npm run pi:sync-local -- --source /absolute/path/to/pi
```

Restore or verify the most recent cached snapshot after npm rewrites `node_modules`:

```bash
npm run pi:sync-local -- --restore
npm run pi:sync-local -- --verify
```

Normal `npm install`, `npm ci`, or `npm dedupe` restores the registry fallback. See [Local pi snapshot updates](./docs/local-pi-update-2026-08-03.md) for package identity, checksums, verification, and rollback details.

## Windows x64 packaging and CI

Build on Windows x64 when possible so npm resolves the correct native dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
npm run electron:win:x64
```

The command creates and verifies `release/win-unpacked/`, then produces the NSIS installer and portable executable from that verified directory. To create only the unpacked directory:

```bash
npm run electron:win:x64:dir
```

The **Windows x64** GitHub Actions workflow runs tests, TypeScript checks, lint, package verification, and a packaged-app smoke test against `/api/home`. Manual runs upload artifacts; tags matching `v*` also create a GitHub Release.

See [GitHub Actions: Windows x64 build guide](./docs/github-build-windows.md) for the complete release workflow and troubleshooting steps.

## Relationship to upstream

This project began from upstream pi-web `v0.7.16` but now deliberately diverges as an Electron-first desktop product. Upstream remains a source for compatible security, SDK, data-integrity, authentication, SSE, and reliability fixes. UI components are adapted selectively rather than replaced wholesale.

Complete feature parity or release-by-release synchronization with upstream pi-web is not guaranteed.
